# mapofraleighbusstops
Hit the API for Raleigh, grabbed the bus stop data, mapped it

Title of the project: Raleigh Bus Tracker

Description of the project: Maps bus stops

How to Run: Load 05_map_automation.html in a browser with mapanimation_raleigh.js in same dir

Roadmap of future improvements: Instead of including all the stops, do them by route. Add styles.css (refers to the mapbox one right now). Add MIT license (added Gnu by accident initially and deleted). 

License information: This should include information about the MIT license.
