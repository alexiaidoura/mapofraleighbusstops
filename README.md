## Title of the project
Raleigh Bus Tracker

## Description of the project
Hit the Transloc Open API for Raleigh, a RESTful API which lets you incorporate real-time vehicle tracking information into your web or mobile applications. Grabbed the bus stop data. Mapped it using mapbox, using an animated map marker. 

## How to Run
Load index.html in a browser with mapanimation_raleigh.js in same dir

## Roadmap of future improvements
* Instead of including all the stops, do them by route (looks like a drunken bus driver at the moment).
